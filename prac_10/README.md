# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were usually close but not perfectly accurate. I often underestimated tasks that involved debugging or unfamiliar concepts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the weeks went on, my estimates became more realistic. I learned to consider setup time, reading instructions, and testing, not just writing code.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned how to break tasks into smaller pieces and evaluate difficulty more clearly. Estimating helped me plan my time better and avoid rushing at the end.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that small issues—like naming, formatting, and missing edge cases—can make a big difference to code readability. Reviewers also helped me notice mistakes I missed.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code trained me to read code more carefully and think about clarity, structure, and maintainability. It also helped me understand different coding styles and better solutions.

### Good Code Review 1

I haven't received the link

### Explanation

In this review, I provided specific suggestions to improve readability and variable naming. I also pointed out a small logic issue and explained why it mattered.

### Good Code Review 2

I haven't received the link

### Explanation

In this review, I focused on code structure and suggested a cleaner approach that reduced duplication. I also highlighted potential edge cases to help the author improve reliability.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more short example videos for each week’s prac. Sometimes reading the instructions alone felt unclear, so a quick walkthrough would help students start faster and with more confidence.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I kept my work well-organised, committed regularly, and followed good coding practices. I also completed the extension tasks when possible and improved my ability to read and understand existing code.
