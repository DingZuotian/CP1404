## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

About 50-60%. I have watched the ones relevant to the current practicals and plan to catch up on the remaining videos soon.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the videos in the evening at home, for about 30–45 minutes per session. I try to schedule 3–4 sessions per week.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been practicing coding regularly and completing practical exercises on time. I also make notes while watching lecture videos, which helps me understand the concepts better.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on watching the lecture videos and start reviewing the concepts more consistently before starting practicals.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I sometimes write code without planning the functions first, which leads to messy code. I will change this by thinking about the function structure and SRP before coding.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am improving in reading instructions carefully and following the SRP principles. I also test my programs step by step, which helps me find errors early.
